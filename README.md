# Gloomhaven Character Manager

A React based web app that help manage characters for the Gloomhaven boardgame.

Written in ReasonML (https://reasonml.github.io/en/) using ReasonReact (https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/).

The backend API is written in F# (https://github.com/Yend0r/gloomhaven-api-fsharp) and there is also a C# version (https://github.com/Yend0r/gloomhaven-api-csharp) because I wanted to compare two projects written in F# and C#.
