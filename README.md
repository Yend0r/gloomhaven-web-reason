# Gloomhaven Character Manager

A React based web app that help manage characters for the Gloomhaven boardgame.

Written in ReasonML (https://reasonml.github.io/en/) using ReasonReact (https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/). ReasonML is basically OCaml with Javascript style syntax. It is transpiled to Javascript using Bucklescript (https://bucklescript.github.io/). ReasonReact makes it very easy to write React apps using Reason (it was made by the creator of ReactJS). 

The backend API for this app is written in F# (https://github.com/Yend0r/gloomhaven-api-fsharp) and there is also a C# version (https://github.com/Yend0r/gloomhaven-api-csharp) because I wanted to compare two projects written in F# and C#.
